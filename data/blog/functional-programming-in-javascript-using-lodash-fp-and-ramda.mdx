# Introduction

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.\
It is a declarative style of programming, focusing on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.\
This article explores functional programming in JavaScript, providing examples using `lodash/fp` and `Ramda`, two JavaScript libraries for functional programming.

# Understanding Functional Programming

Functional programming includes the following key concepts:

1. **Pure Functions**: A function is said to be pure if it always returns the same result for the same input and it doesn't have any observable side effect.

2. **Immutability**: Data is unchanging, meaning that we create new data structures instead of altering existing ones.

3. **First-class functions**: Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned by other functions, and assigned as a value to a variable.

4. **High-order functions**: These are functions that take one or more functions as arguments and return a function as its result.

## Functional Programming with lodash/fp

`lodash/fp` is a set of utility functions for functional programming tasks. All the lodash utility functions are available in a functional programming-friendly style, meaning they are automatically curried, and iteratees are capped.

### Example 1: Using map and reduce

```javascript
import { flow, map, multiply, reduce, add } from 'lodash/fp';

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubleAndSum = flow(map(multiply(2)), reduce(add, 0));

console.log(doubleAndSum(nums)); // Output: 30
```

In this example, `fp.flow` is used to create a new function that transforms the input array by doubling its elements (using `fp.map`) and then summing them (using `fp.reduce`).

## Functional Programming with Ramda

`Ramda` is another JavaScript library that facilitates functional programming. It is lightweight and fast, as it doesn't extend the prototypes of JavaScript's built-in objects, making it a better option for functional programming in some cases.

### Example 2: Using compose and filter

```javascript
import { compose, map, multiply, filter, modulo, equals, __ } from "ramda";

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const getEvenAndDouble = compose(
  map(multiply(2)),
  filter(compose(equals(0), modulo(__, 2)))
);

console.log(getEvenAndDouble(nums)); // Output: [4, 8, 12]
```

In this example, `R.compose` is used to create a new function that first filters the even numbers in the input array (using `R.filter`) and then doubles them (using `R.map`).

# Summary

Functional programming is a powerful paradigm that can help you write cleaner, more modular, and more testable code. `lodash/fp` and `Ramda` are two libraries that provide a host of utility functions to aid with functional programming in JavaScript.\
By understanding and utilizing these tools effectively, you can create applications that are easier to read, debug, and maintain.
