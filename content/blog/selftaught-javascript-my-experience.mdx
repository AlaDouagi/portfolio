# Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />

# How it started

Summer of 2013, I just finished my studies for high school and got my baccalaureate degree in Natural Science,
while I wasn't a good student in Computer Science, I had close friends at that time who were studying it at University;
They recommended that I choose it as a specialty for my university orientation,
one of the big reasons was that CS graduates usually don't suffer from unemployment afterward, and as I was financially not doing good,
I had to be pragmatic and choose CS for the better.

# The struggle to fall in love with programming

During my first semester at the university, it was hard to cope with all the changes that were imposed on me;
The subjects, the proactivity to research and understand all of the new topics that I barely knew even existed before.\
Frankly, I was some kind of an introvert; I had problems getting used to student life even laterward and until graduation;
this transition and what it came with made me anxious, and in turn, I was not caring so much about my studies,
I only cared about getting the grades that would enable me to promote to the next class in any manner.\
Before the exams period came, I had to pass 3 practical tests for C programming language in different weeks,
the average would be calculated as the mark of that subject, 1st test was mediocre, and I got not such a bad mark,
for the 2nd test, I had to cheat, but I was exposed when explaining the code because I had no idea how the project worked,
and for that, I got a 0 mark, and I felt bad about it, so I had to get an excellent mark for the last test without cheating...

# Revelation

The last test was about a Card Game in the C programming language; I had my full focus on it; I had to be excellent and make something special.
I was researching and was able to create a function in the project that prints colored cards; no one thought about investing an effort in this feature.\
Then I was able to cover 95% of the game's logic; doing all of this while I was not good at programming was weird. Am I really bad at it?\
On the test day, I was next to the professor; I started executing the project and showing all of the features that I had implemented,
from the facial expression of the professor, I could tell she was a bit amazed; she told me to open the source code and explain it,
then I did go through the code fluidly; after that, she told me something that I still remember to this day:

> Was it you, the same person that came cheating last time and didn't understand a thing from programming?

From that day on, I knew that I had the potential to be a programmer, and C programming language became an easy subject for me after it was the opposite.

# Snap back to reality

After a couple of years, although I had several personal problems along the way, I did manage to graduate in the summer of 2016.\
Being a fresh graduate wasn't an attractive profile for most employers, and I knew that, and I'm also convinced that I need to choose a specialty and master it before starting to apply for job offers.\
I embraced unemployment, then started to look for a specialty with these criteria:

- Well-demanded in the IT job market.
- It will stick for several years laterward.

After several days of research, the choice was clear; it is **JavaScript**.\
And for that, I spent a year learning JavaScript; I did find a freelance job along the way and worked on it for 3 months, but it was a disaster; I had to work on the full project on my own, from UI design to database.\
I wasn't able to cover all the workload on my own, and eventually, I got burned out and quit that job;\
As I badly needed an income at that time, this was a sensitive period for me; my self-esteem was at its lowest.\
But I had to encourage myself and continue learning and improving my skills; I built several personal mini-projects and got a broader idea about Full-stack JavaScript development.

# My first full-time job

After feeling ready to seek a job, I prepared a CV and started applying; I got a response from [xTECH](https://www.xtech.guru/) and did a good interview later.\
In December 2017, I started my first job there; the location of the office was in a calm neighborhood by the beach, and the atmosphere was great within the team; this was more than what I wanted.\
It was the first time where I worked with a team; I had to understand the methodologies and how to collaborate on the shared code base, I saw how other senior colleagues think and code, and it had an impact on me.\
After almost 3 years spent in xTECH, I learned a lot and enhanced my soft skills, and gained a lot of experience in coding JavaScript.

# Learnings from my journey

Being lost for a while is something most people have to deal with, especially at the beginning; this happened to me and might happen to others that are just starting their careers as a developer.\
I overcame the doubts that I had through hard work and teaching myself what I needed to know to be a better developer, and until this day, I'm still in the learning process.
